# SqlOperator

Operate sql databases, users and grants.

> This is a WIP project and should not at all be used in production at this time.
> Feel free to validate in CI pipelines.

# Engines

Currenty, only MySQL is supported.

## Example

```yaml

  endpoint:
    host: 192.168.1.123
    port: 3306
  credentials:
    username: sqloperator
    password: xxxxxxxxxxx

---
# Create a database on the host
apiVersion: stenic.io/v1alpha1
kind: SqlDatabase
metadata:
  name: sqldatabase-sample
spec:
  databaseName: test123
  hostRef:
    name: sqlhost-sample
  cleanupPolicy: Delete

---
# Create a user on the host
apiVersion: stenic.io/v1alpha1
